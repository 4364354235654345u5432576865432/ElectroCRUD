### CRUD?
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage (Database).

### Why?
After a failed search for a basic admin panel that not involves writing code or installs web-based solutions, I come with ElectroCRUD idea.

### ElectroCRUD v1
The ElectroCRUD v1 was born in 2016, An Electron application that made it possible to create a friendly dashboard with data tables, search, widgets, filter & relations with few clicks without any experience in programming.

### ElectroCRUD v2
After a few years that the project was inactive, I decided to bring it an alive again. The codebase was build from scratch using Electron+Angular8. Many of the original functionality is still missing, but I'm working to cover backward compatibility.
